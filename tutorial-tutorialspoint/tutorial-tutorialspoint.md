| Function              | Description                                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| int(x [,base])        | Converts x to an integer. The base specifies the base if x is a string. |
| float(x)              | Converts x to a floating-point number.                                  |
| complex(real [,imag]) | Creates a complex number.                                               |
| str(x)                | Converts object x to a string representation.                           |
| repr(x)               | Converts object x to an expression string.                              |
| eval(str)             | Evaluates a string and returns an object.                               |
| tuple(s)              | Converts s to a tuple.                                                  |
| list(s)               | Converts s to a list.                                                   |
| set(s)                | Converts s to a set.                                                    |
| dict(d)               | Creates a dictionary. d must be a sequence of (key,value) tuples.       |
| frozenset(s)          | Converts s to a frozen set.                                             |
| chr(x)                | Converts an integer to a character.                                     |
| unichr(x)             | Converts an integer to a Unicode character.                             |
| ord(x)                | Converts a single character to its integer value.                       |
| hex(x)                | Converts an integer to a hexadecimal string.                            |
| oct(x)                | Converts an integer to an octal string.                                 |
